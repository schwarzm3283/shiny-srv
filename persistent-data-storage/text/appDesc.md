This app is a demonstration of how to store data from a shiny app in a *persistent* way so that the data can be retrieved again later.  

For more information on this topic, read [the associated tutorial on persistent data storage](http://deanattali.com/blog/shiny-persistent-data-storage/).  

In this app, the data that is saved and restored is user-submitted responses to a form. This is a practical use case of saving data from a shiny app. For a guide on how to build forms with Shiny, see [this tutorial](http://deanattali.com/2015/06/14/mimicking-google-form-shiny/).
